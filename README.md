# CoinTrackur (still in development)
> Real-time Cryptocurrency price / marketcap tracker in ReactJS and Vanilla JS
I made this project for educational purposes only the cryptocurrencies i have included in this project are the crypto's i am invested in.
This doesnt mean that you should put your money in those crypto's too, i am not a financial advisor whuahuahua :grinning: :grinning:
